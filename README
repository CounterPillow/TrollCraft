TROLLCRAFT

This is a small "game" that throws the player into a fake minecraft environment with scary stuff and things.
It is being developed by CounterPillow to prank one of his friends, who believes that Herobrine is real.

TrollCraft uses ZauberCraft written by Noobody. (noobody.org)

Due to copyright restrictions, I had to leave the resources away. The following stuff is missing:
terrain.png - The minecraft terrain.png, converted to Black & White Image with the water tiles colored red
ambient.ogg - Wind sound which is being looped. I converted a soundfile of Left4Dead2

All code is being released under the terms and conditions of the zlib license, if not stated otherwise in the file itself
or in any other file or text written by the author.

Please note that this is still under heavy developement, and you are using it on your own risk. I can not be held liable
for any damages that may occur directly or indirectly by executing this software.

it's very foggy.
